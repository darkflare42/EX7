Answers to Questions:
- Handling errors:
   To handle the different types of errors, we created a parent CompilationException class that all compilation related
   exceptions need to inherit from. We did this in order to differentiate between an IOException (I.E. reading the given
   file) and compilation exceptions, the ones we expected to catch as a part of the exercise.
   In order to answer the requirement to post an error message regarding the error in question, should we encounter one,
   every CompilationException sub class calls the super constructor with a String, explaining the error caught.
   If and when a CompilationException is caught, it can be accessed
- Date structure used:
  For every type of an array, I used an ArrayList because they were overall the best Collection for me (for adding,
  removing and iterating on).
